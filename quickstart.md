# 🚀 Quick Start

## Starting from scratch (no IDE installed)

1. Complete **one** of the first two modules manually — they guide you through installation:
   - [Installing VSCode + GitHub Copilot](docs/modules/010-installing-vscode-github-copilot/walkthrough.md) — recommended for most users
   - [Installing Cursor](docs/modules/020-installing-cursor/walkthrough.md) — alternative AI-native IDE
2. At the end of the module, you'll find a link — paste it into the AI Chat in your IDE
3. From that point on, the AI agent conducts the entire training for you 🤖

## Already have an IDE with AI assistant?

If you already have VS Code + Copilot, Cursor, or another AI-enabled IDE installed, skip the installation modules.

Paste this link directly into your AI Chat (Copilot Chat, Cursor Chat, etc.):

```
https://github.com/codenjoyme/vibecoding-training/blob/main/docs/modules/025-downloading-course-materials/walkthrough.md
```

The agent will download the course repository, set everything up, and start guiding you through the modules — fully automatically.
