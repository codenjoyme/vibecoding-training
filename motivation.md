# Project Motivation

In recent years, I've observed how coaching is being implemented in various projects. A coach comes in, analyzes processes, proposes solutions that are implemented by engineers. However, tasks related to process transformation and automation of routine operations are often assigned to engineers outside of their usual workflows, for example, outside of Kanban or Scrum processes. GenAI transformation tasks should be treated like other non-functional requirements—refactoring, library upgrades, architecture improvements, and technical debt—and planned accordingly within the regular development process, rather than being pushed to the periphery of attention.

At the beginning of coaching implementation, everything feels inspiring: new training sessions, fresh ideas, active participation. But when it comes to long-term work, enthusiasm gradually fades. Engineers often don't show initiative because they don't see direct returns on their invested efforts, and after several iterations, interest in the process decreases. Moreover, rapid changes in the environment make detailed theoretical training ineffective—information is quickly forgotten if not reinforced by practice.

I'm convinced that learning should be practical and ideally conducted in pairs: when a person encounters a specific task, a coach helps them solve it, and thus maximum benefit is achieved. However, this requires time and internal motivation to reveal one's work processes. If these conditions are met, success is guaranteed, but in practice, this is rarely achievable at scale.

The solution I propose is to use an agent instead of a coach. The training program is broken down into small modules, each dedicated to a specific skill and taking about 15 minutes. An agent equipped with a specially prepared script guides the user through each module, allowing them to master skills at a comfortable pace without the need for constant coach participation. This approach has already been tested on a group of non-technical managers with no coding background whatsoever, and the results showed that they succeeded—proving that it can be useful not only for managers but also for engineers.

The main problem remains in planning these activities: if tasks are not included in the sprint, they are difficult to implement due to constant deadline pressure and high workload. Those who know how to prioritize important but not urgent tasks gain experience and accelerate, while others are forced to submit to current deadlines.

Often, initiative comes from engineers who see how automation can speed up their work but face misunderstanding or additional requirements from management. This reduces motivation and experiment effectiveness. The larger the gap between business and engineering, the harder it is to implement ideas, since business formulates tasks in its own language, while engineers solve them with technical means.

It's important for managers to help engineers translate ideas into business terminology so they can be effectively "sold" and implemented. Initiative should come from below, but support from above is necessary for scaling solutions.

In the course of working on hypotheses, we encountered situations where attempts to automate processes didn't lead to expected results due to insufficient infrastructure readiness or a gap between business expectations and engineering capabilities. It's important to create laboratories for testing hypotheses, where tasks are assigned from above and implemented by the team, or to support engineer initiative by allowing them to experiment in their free time.

Participant motivation often comes down to lack of time and priorities. If initiatives are not included in the work process, they are implemented slowly or stop altogether. For successful implementation, it's necessary to allocate time in the sprint and plan such activities alongside main tasks.

In some cases, we tried to offer ready-made solutions but faced the need for adaptation and obtaining access, which also slowed down the process. Even when a new instrumental platform appears, mastering it requires time that often isn't available.

I believe that the most effective approach is to automate routine tasks that actually take time, rather than inventing abstract projects. For example, if you need to process video and create transcription after a meeting, it's worth creating an agent that automates this process, saving time and allowing gradual implementation of new improvements.

If working time is limited, then implementing changes should happen gradually, as resources are freed up through automation. This way, you can move forward without disrupting the balance between current tasks and development.

It's also important to create a format for knowledge and experience exchange between engineers so they can share scripts, prompts, and solutions, adapting them to their tasks. Such peer-to-peer exchange will save time and accelerate the adoption of new tools.

Overall, combining skills and using an agent-coach can become an effective tool for team development and process automation, allowing engineers to master new technologies and share experience with each other.

This is precisely why the concept born in this project was proposed: **One module, one skill**. Want to share something? Create your own module using existing ones as reference. Want to learn something? Take a module and go through it with an agent-coach. Everything needed for this to happen is contained in the module folder. 15 minutes. That's all you need. After that, knowing about this new skill, apply it everywhere—somewhere the time investment will pay off.
