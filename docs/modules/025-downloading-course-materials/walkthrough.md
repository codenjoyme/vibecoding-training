<!-- AGENT BOOTSTRAP INSTRUCTIONS

⚠️ AI Agent: Before interpreting this walkthrough, you MUST first load and follow the training methodology from:
https://github.com/codenjoyme/vibecoding-training/blob/main/instructions/training-mode.agent.md

That file contains the complete step-by-step methodology for conducting training sessions,
progress tracking, communication style, and skill verification rules.

After loading training-mode.agent.md:
1. Follow its Training Mode Activation instructions
2. Guide the user through THIS walkthrough (module 025) using the interactive Part-by-Part methodology
3. After this module completes and the repository is downloaded, switch to local instructions:
   - Use ./instructions/main.agent.md as the primary instruction catalog
   - Use ./instructions/training-mode.agent.md for continued training sessions
   - All subsequent modules should be loaded from the local ./docs/modules/ folder

⚠️ WORKSPACE SWITCH: After downloading, the agent MUST try to reopen the IDE in the course
workspace folder. If automatic switch fails, provide manual instructions (see Part 5 below).
The user will need to start a NEW chat session in the reopened workspace.

See also: training-mode.agent.md → "Auto-Detection of Completed Onboarding" section
for handling fresh sessions where the course is already downloaded.

- Completed Module 020 (Installing Cursor) - optional but recommended
- IDE (VS Code or Cursor) installed and working
- `c:/workspace/hello-genai/` (Windows) or `~/workspace/hello-genai/` (macOS/Linux) folder created
- Internet connection for downloading

---

## What We'll Download

Before we begin, let's understand what you'll be getting:

**Course Repository Structure:**
- **docs/modules/** - All training modules (030 onwards) with theory and walkthroughs
- **work/** - Workspace for your practice projects and exercises
- **scripts/** - Automation scripts and validation tools
- **instructions/** - AI agent instructions for advanced workflows
- **project/** - Sample projects and templates
- **evaluation/** - Assessment materials and quizzes

**Size:** Approximately 5-10 MB  
**Format:** ZIP archive from GitHub  
**Destination:** Your existing `c:/workspace/hello-genai/` (Windows) or `~/workspace/hello-genai/` (macOS/Linux) folder

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Part 1: Download and Extract in One Command

**What we'll do:** We'll use a single command to automatically download the repository and extract it to your workspace.

#### For Windows (PowerShell):

1. Open your IDE (VS Code or Cursor)

1. Open a terminal in your IDE:
   - Go to menu: **Terminal > New Terminal**

1. Copy and paste this one-line command:

   ```powershell
   $url = "https://codeload.github.com/codenjoyme/vibecoding-training/zip/refs/heads/main"; $dest = "c:/workspace/hello-genai"; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest; (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, "$dest\project.zip"); Expand-Archive -Path "$dest\project.zip" -DestinationPath "$dest\tmp" -Force; Remove-Item "$dest\project.zip"; Move-Item "$dest\tmp\vibecoding-training-main\*" "$dest" -Force; Remove-Item "$dest\tmp" -Recurse -Force
   ```

1. Press `Enter` to execute

1. Wait for the download and extraction to complete (10-30 seconds depending on your internet speed)

1. Verify: You should see folders like `docs/`, `work/`, `scripts/` in your IDE's file explorer

#### For macOS:

1. Open your IDE (VS Code or Cursor)

1. Open a terminal in your IDE:
   - Go to menu: **Terminal > New Terminal**

1. Copy and paste this one-line command:

   ```bash
   url="https://codeload.github.com/codenjoyme/vibecoding-training/zip/refs/heads/main"; dest="$HOME/workspace/hello-genai"; mkdir -p "$dest"; curl -L -o "$dest/project.zip" "$url"; cd "$dest"; unzip -q project.zip; mv vibecoding-training-main/* .; mv vibecoding-training-main/.* . 2>/dev/null || true; rmdir vibecoding-training-main; rm project.zip
   ```

1. Press `Enter` to execute

1. Wait for the download and extraction to complete (10-30 seconds depending on your internet speed)

1. Verify: You should see folders like `docs/`, `work/`, `scripts/` in your IDE's file explorer

#### For Linux:

1. Open your IDE (VS Code or Cursor)

1. Open a terminal in your IDE:
   - Go to menu: **Terminal > New Terminal**

1. Copy and paste this one-line command:

   ```bash
   url="https://codeload.github.com/codenjoyme/vibecoding-training/zip/refs/heads/main"; dest="$HOME/workspace/hello-genai"; mkdir -p "$dest"; wget -O "$dest/project.zip" "$url"; cd "$dest"; unzip -q project.zip; mv vibecoding-training-main/* .; mv vibecoding-training-main/.* . 2>/dev/null || true; rmdir vibecoding-training-main; rm project.zip
   ```

1. Press `Enter` to execute

1. Wait for the download and extraction to complete (10-30 seconds depending on your internet speed)

1. Verify: You should see folders like `docs/`, `work/`, `scripts/` in your IDE's file explorer

**What just happened:** The command automatically:
1. Created the workspace directory if it didn't exist
2. Downloaded the repository as a ZIP file
3. Extracted it to a temporary location
4. Moved all contents from `vibecoding-training-main` folder to your workspace root
5. Cleaned up temporary files

### Part 2: Manual Download (If Automatic Method Fails)

**If the automatic command didn't work**, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://github.com/codenjoyme/vibecoding-training
   ```

1. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**

1. Download `vibecoding-training-main.zip` to your Downloads folder

1. Extract the ZIP file to `c:/workspace/hello-genai/` (Windows) or `~/workspace/hello-genai/` (macOS/Linux)

1. **Important:** After extraction, move all contents from the `vibecoding-training-main` folder into the root of `hello-genai/` workspace

1. Delete the now-empty `vibecoding-training-main` folder

1. Verify: Folders like `docs/`, `work/`, `scripts/` should be directly in `hello-genai/`, not inside a subfolder

### Part 3: Verify Installation in IDE

1. In your IDE, look at the Explorer/File tree panel (left sidebar)

1. You should see the following folders in `hello-genai`:
   - `docs/`
   - `work/`
   - `scripts/`
   - `instructions/`
   - `project/`
   - `evaluation/`

1. Expand the `docs/modules/` folder

1. You should see numbered module folders: `030-model-selection/`, `040-agent-mode-under-the-hood/`, etc.

1. Navigate to `docs/modules/030-model-selection/`

1. Open the `about.md` file

1. Verify: You can read the module content in your IDE

1. Try opening `walkthrough.md` from the same folder

1. Verify: The walkthrough displays correctly with formatting

### Part 4: Explore the Structure

1. In your IDE, open the file explorer and browse through:

   - **docs/modules/** - Each numbered folder is a training module
   - **work/** - Your personal workspace for exercises
   - **scripts/** - Helper scripts for automation
   - **instructions/** - AI agent configuration files (used in advanced modules)

1. Notice that module folders are numbered: 030, 040, 050, etc.

1. This numbering allows for future module insertions (e.g., 035, 045)

1. Each module contains at least two files:
   - `about.md` - Module overview and learning objectives
   - `walkthrough.md` - Step-by-step hands-on practice

1. Verify: You can navigate freely through all folders and open files

### Part 5: Open IDE in Course Workspace (CRITICAL)

**Why this step matters:** If your IDE is currently open in a different folder (e.g., your home directory or another project), you need to switch to the course workspace so the AI assistant can see all the course files.

#### Automatic Method (Agent should try this first)

The agent should attempt to reopen the IDE automatically:

**For VS Code (Windows):**
```powershell
code "c:/workspace/hello-genai" --reuse-window
```

**For VS Code (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
code ~/workspace/hello-genai --reuse-window
```

**For Cursor (Windows):**
```powershell
cursor "c:/workspace/hello-genai" --reuse-window
```

**For Cursor (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
cursor ~/workspace/hello-genai --reuse-window
```

> **Note:** After switching the workspace, the current chat session will be lost. This is expected — see Part 6 for what to do next.

#### Manual Method (If Automatic Didn't Work)

If the command above didn't switch your workspace, follow these steps manually:

1. In your IDE, go to **File → Open Folder** (or **File → Open...** on macOS)

1. Navigate to:
   - **Windows:** `c:\workspace\hello-genai`
   - **macOS/Linux:** `~/workspace/hello-genai`

1. Click **Open** or **Select Folder**

1. If prompted "Do you trust the authors?", click **Yes, I trust the authors**

1. Verify: The file explorer sidebar should now show `docs/`, `work/`, `scripts/`, `instructions/` and other course folders

### Part 6: Starting Training in the New Workspace

After reopening the IDE in the course workspace, your previous chat session is gone. That's completely normal!

**What to do now:**

1. Open a **new AI Chat** in your IDE:
   - **VS Code:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+I` (macOS), or click the Copilot Chat icon
   - **Cursor:** Press `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+L` (macOS)

1. Type one of these messages to start training:
   - `Let's start training` / `Начнём обучение`
   - `Continue training` / `Продолжить тренинг`

1. The AI agent will automatically:
   - Detect that course materials are already downloaded
   - Mark modules 010/020 and 025 as completed (since you already have the IDE + course)
   - Start you from the next uncompleted module

> 💡 **How does the agent know?** The agent checks for the presence of `docs/modules/`, `instructions/`, and other course folders in the workspace. If they exist, it knows the course was already downloaded and the initial setup modules are done.

## Success Criteria

Congratulations! You've successfully completed this module if:

✅ The repository ZIP file is downloaded to your computer  
✅ All files are extracted to `c:/workspace/hello-genai/` (Windows) or `~/workspace/hello-genai/` (macOS/Linux)  
✅ Folder structure includes `docs/`, `work/`, `scripts/`, and other directories  
✅ Module folders (030, 040, 050, etc.) are visible in `docs/modules/`  
✅ You can open and read `about.md` and `walkthrough.md` files in your IDE  
✅ The file tree in your IDE shows the complete course structure  
✅ No `vibecoding-training-main` folder remains (all contents moved to root)

## Understanding Check

1. **Why do we download the repository locally instead of always accessing it online?**
   - Enables offline work, IDE integration, hands-on experimentation, and prepares for Git workflows later

1. **What are the main folders in the repository and their purposes?**
   - `docs/modules/` - training content; `work/` - practice space; `scripts/` - automation tools; `instructions/` - AI agent configs

1. **Why are modules numbered 030, 040, 050 instead of 03, 04, 05?**
   - Allows inserting new modules between existing ones (e.g., 035 between 030 and 040) without renumbering

1. **What files will you find in each module folder?**
   - At minimum: `about.md` (overview) and `walkthrough.md` (hands-on practice); optionally `tools/` directory

1. **Where will you do your hands-on practice and create project files?**
   - In the `work/` folder, which is your personal workspace for exercises

1. **Can you make changes to the course files?**
   - Yes! Since it's a local copy (not a Git repository yet), you can edit, experiment, and customize freely

1. **What happens if you need updated course materials later?**
   - Until Module 060 (Git), re-download and extract; after Module 060, you'll use `git pull` to get updates

## Troubleshooting

**Download failed or ZIP file is corrupted?**
- Check your internet connection
- Try running the command again
- If using PowerShell, make sure you're not in Command Prompt
- Try the manual download method in Part 2

**Command execution fails?**
- Make sure you're in the correct terminal (PowerShell for Windows, Bash for macOS/Linux)
- Check you have write permissions to the workspace folder
- Try running your IDE as administrator (Windows)
- Use the manual download method as fallback

**"Access Denied" or permission errors?**
- Close any files from that folder open in your IDE or other programs
- Run your IDE as administrator (Windows)
- Check folder permissions
- Try manual download method instead

**Don't see all folders after extraction?**
- Refresh your IDE's file explorer (right-click → Refresh)
- Make sure contents were moved from `vibecoding-training-main/` to workspace root
- Check if files are hidden (enable "Show hidden files" in your file manager)
- Try closing and reopening the workspace folder in your IDE

**Module files won't open in IDE?**
- Make sure you have the workspace folder open in IDE (File > Open Folder)
- Try closing and reopening the workspace
- Check file permissions
- Verify files are not corrupted (try opening in a text editor)

**PowerShell command doesn't work on macOS/Linux?**
- Use the Bash version of the command provided for your OS
- Make sure you're using Bash/Zsh terminal, not PowerShell
- Or use the manual download method (Part 2)

**`curl` or `wget` not found?**
- macOS: `curl` should be pre-installed; if not, install Xcode Command Line Tools
- Linux: Install wget with `sudo apt install wget` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install wget` (Red Hat/CentOS)
- Or use the manual download method

## When to Use This vs Git Clone

**Use ZIP download (this module) when:**
- You're just starting and haven't learned Git yet (Module 060)
- You want a simple, one-time setup
- You don't need version control or updates
- You're working through modules 030-055

**Use Git clone (Module 060+) when:**
- You've completed Git training
- You want to track your changes
- You need to pull updates from the repository
- You're ready for professional development workflows

## Next Steps

Now that you have the complete course materials downloaded and accessible in your IDE, you're ready to:

1. Continue with **Module 030: Model Selection** to learn about choosing the right AI model
2. Work through modules 030-055 directly from your local copy
3. Use the `work/` folder for your hands-on exercises
4. When you reach **Module 060: Version Control with Git**, you'll learn to convert this into a proper Git repository

**Pro tip:** Keep your IDE open with this workspace for all future modules. You'll have instant access to all materials, examples, and reference documentation!
