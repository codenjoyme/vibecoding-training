# AI Skills & Tools Creation

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Skill:** Create reliable AI skills by combining instructions with parameterized tools to eliminate hallucinations

**👉 [Start hands-on walkthrough](walkthrough.md)**

## Topics

- Why LLMs hallucinate calculations and operations
- Creating parameterized tools (scripts) for precise tasks
- Writing instructions to guide tool usage
- The Skill formula: Instruction + Tool = Reliable capability
- Colocation of instructions and tools
- AgentSkills.io standard (optional, emerging)
- Building reusable skill libraries

## Learning Outcome

Transform unreliable AI calculations into accurate, repeatable skills by packaging instructions with executable tools. Learn when to stop asking AI to "do" and start asking it to "create a tool that does."

## Prerequisites

- Complete [Learning from Hallucinations](../080-learning-from-hallucinations/about.md) module
- Familiar with creating and refining instruction files
- Basic understanding of scripting (Python, PowerShell, or Bash)

## When to Use

- AI needs to perform precise calculations or operations
- You need reproducible, auditable results
- Building reusable capabilities for your team
- Integrating with external APIs or services
- Processing data that requires exact transformations
- Any task where AI hallucination is unacceptable
