# DIAL Integration with Python and Langchain

**Duration:** 7-10 minutes

**Skill:** Set up Python virtual environment, install langchain framework, and build a working AI application that connects to EPAM AI DIAL programmatically.

**👉 [Start hands-on walkthrough](walkthrough.md)**

## Topics

- Python virtual environment setup and dependency management
- Installing langchain and Azure OpenAI integration packages
- Configuring environment variables securely with .env files
- Connecting to DIAL using langchain's AzureChatOpenAI interface
- Building conversational AI scripts with proper error handling
- Understanding langchain abstractions over raw API calls

## Learning Outcome

You will create a fully functional Python application with isolated virtual environment, install all necessary dependencies, configure DIAL credentials securely, and execute a working script that queries EPAM AI models through langchain framework. Your script will demonstrate proper project structure for AI application development.

## Prerequisites

- Module 170: DIAL API Key and cURL Access completed
- Valid DIAL API key obtained from EPAM support
- Python 3.10+ installed on your system
- Basic understanding of command line operations
- No advanced programming knowledge required

## When to Use

- Building AI-powered applications with Python
- Developing chatbots or conversational interfaces
- Integrating AI into data processing pipelines
- Creating prototypes that need AI capabilities
- When you need more control than simple cURL requests
- Projects requiring conversation history and context management
