## Hands-on Project

After completing all modules, participants will build a complete application that demonstrates:
- Web interface
- Automation scripts
- MCP integration
- Proper version control
- Quality assurance

**Expected Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Evaluation:** AI-powered automated assessment
