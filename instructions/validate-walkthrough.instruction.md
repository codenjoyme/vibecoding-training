2. Find section "walkthrough.md File Structure" - these are the requirements
3. Read the `walkthrough.md` file in current directory
4. Compare `walkthrough.md` against requirements from step 2
5. Create file `todo.md` in current directory
6. Write ONLY checklist of missing/incorrect elements to `todo.md`

## Output Format example for `todo.md`
