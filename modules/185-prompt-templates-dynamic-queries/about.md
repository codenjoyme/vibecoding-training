# Prompt Templates for Dynamic Queries

**Duration:** 5-7 minutes

**Skill:** Use Langchain prompt templates to create reusable, parameterized AI queries that adapt to different inputs without rewriting prompts

**👉 [Start hands-on walkthrough](walkthrough.md)**

## Topics

- Understanding prompt templates vs hardcoded prompts
- Creating parameterized prompts with input variables
- Formatting templates with dynamic values
- Building reusable query patterns for consistent AI interactions
- Template benefits: maintainability, testability, and flexibility

## Learning Outcome

You'll create dynamic prompt templates that accept variables (topic, style, format), format them into structured queries, and generate AI responses. This enables building scalable AI applications where prompts are managed as reusable code rather than duplicated strings.

## Prerequisites

- **180-dial-langchain-python-integration** - Python environment with Langchain installed
- Python virtual environment activated in `work/python-ai-workspace`
- DIAL API credentials configured in `.env` file
- Basic understanding of string formatting and variables

## When to Use

- Building applications with repeated query patterns (e.g., product descriptions, email templates)
- Creating prompt libraries for team collaboration
- Parameterizing AI queries for A/B testing different styles or formats
- Generating content variations (same template, different inputs)
- Maintaining consistency across multiple AI interactions
- Separating prompt logic from application code
