## Topics

- Understanding AI agent memory limitations
- Built-in todo tool for task tracking
- How to find and enable built-in tools (VSCode and Cursor)
- Creating external Markdown todo lists for complex workflows
- Using @-mentions to reference todo lists in prompts
- Combining memory techniques with agent mode
- When to use built-in vs external todo lists

## Learning Outcome

Ability to guide AI agents through multi-step tasks by providing persistent memory through todo lists, enabling autonomous execution of complex workflows without losing context

## Prerequisites

- Basic prompting skills from module 050
- Understanding of agent mode from module 040
- Familiarity with clarifying requirements from module 055

## When to Use

- Multi-step tasks spanning multiple files or components
