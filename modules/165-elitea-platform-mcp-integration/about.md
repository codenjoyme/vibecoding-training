**Skill:** Connect to Elitea platform and manage AI agents through MCP from VS Code

**👉 [Start hands-on walkthrough](walkthrough.md)**

## Topics

- Authentication on Elitea Platform with EPAM credentials
- Creating no-code agents on Elitea cloud platform
- Configuring agent settings and "mcp" tag for MCP access
- Generating MCP personal tokens for API access
- Installing Elitea MCP client with Python virtual environment
- Configuring MCP in VS Code with Elitea server
- Executing tasks through cloud-based agents from IDE

## Learning Outcome

You will be able to create and configure AI agents on Elitea no-code platform, connect them to VS Code through MCP, and execute tasks directly from your IDE. You'll understand the benefits of cloud-based agent systems versus local tools and how to manage multiple agents through a unified MCP interface.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Module 100: Model Context Protocol (MCP)](../100-mcp-model-context-protocol/about.md)
- Completed [Module 105: MCP GitHub Integration - Issues Management](../105-mcp-github-integration-issues/about.md)
- Active EPAM account with access to Elitea platform
- Python installed on local machine
- Basic understanding of virtual environments

## When to Use

- Need enterprise-grade agent infrastructure without local installation
- Want to create no-code AI agents for team collaboration
- Require centralized management of AI agents
- Need to execute cloud-based AI tasks from your IDE
- Want to avoid local resource usage for AI processing
- Building production workflows with professional AI infrastructure
